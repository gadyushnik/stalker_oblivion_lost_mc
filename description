Hi. Stalker Oblivion Lost MC Project [â€‹WIP] - is a big S.T.A.L.K.E.R. project in Minecraft, based on builds. Builds are alpha and beta versions of the first game of the legendary series - Shadows of Chernobyl. The point is that from the announcement to the release of the first part, it took 7 years. During this time the devs managed to create a huge amount of content, and then decided to cut out everything that in their opinion looked crude and unfinished closer to the release. And the aim of our project is just to recreate that desolate, gloomy and primordial, dangerous and mysterious zone.

On our future java server you will see:

- a variety of unique armor and a large arsenal of weapons
- driveable vehicles
- npcs, quests and large quest lines, factions
- mutants and bosses
- artefacts and anomalies
- user clans and clan wars
- large ground and underground locations
